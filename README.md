# Practical Guideline

For a majority of your assignments you will create issues on GitHub.

In order to create an issue you will travel to the tab marked as `Issues`:

![](/assets/issue_one.png)

Once you click on that tab you will see all the current issues in this repository. At this point, no issues have been created. Let's create a new issue by clicking `New issue`

![](/assets/issue_two.png)

Once you have created a new issue, you will be greeted by the screen below. Here you will provide
* A title for your issue (Every title should be the name of the assignment, so in this case it is "Practical Assignment")
* A body for your issue to write a response or upload a screenshot
* A submission button

For this assignment, copy the question below and paste it into the body of the issue, then answer it:

`Given what you have learned about Git, why would you want to use Git in your classroom?`
